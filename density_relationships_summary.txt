SUMMARY OF DENSITY RELATIONSHIPS IN SEAWATER
===========================================

1. EFFECTS OF PRESSURE ON DENSITY:
   - Seawater density increases with pressure (depth).
   - For typical ocean parameters, density increases by approximately 4-5% 
     from the surface to the deep ocean (~10,000m).
   - This effect is nearly linear and is due to the compression of water molecules.

2. EFFECTS OF TEMPERATURE ON DENSITY:
   - Seawater density generally decreases as temperature increases.
   - The relationship is non-linear, with the greatest effect in colder waters.
   - Unlike freshwater, seawater's density typically does not have a maximum 
     at 4°C due to the presence of salt.
   - Temperature can cause density variations of approximately 1-2% 
     across oceanic temperature ranges (typically -2°C to 30°C).

3. EFFECTS OF SALINITY ON DENSITY:
   - Seawater density increases with salinity.
   - The relationship is nearly linear.
   - Across typical ocean salinity ranges (33-37 PSU), density varies by around 0.3-0.4%.
   - When comparing fresh water to typical seawater, the difference is about 2-3%.

4. ABSOLUTE VS. PRACTICAL SALINITY:
   - Absolute Salinity (SA, g/kg) is the mass fraction of dissolved material in seawater.
   - Practical Salinity (SP, PSU) is a conductivity-based scale without units.
   - The difference between them varies geographically due to variations in seawater composition.
   - The difference is typically 0.1-0.5 g/kg higher for Absolute Salinity.
   - Largest differences occur in the North Pacific and Indian Ocean due to silicate content.

5. CONSERVATIVE VS. IN-SITU TEMPERATURE:
   - Conservative Temperature (CT) represents the heat content of seawater.
   - In-situ Temperature (t) is the measured temperature at a specific pressure.
   - CT is more appropriate for heat budget calculations.
   - Differences increase with pressure and are largest in warm, deep waters.
   - CT is typically slightly lower than in-situ temperature at depth.

6. COMBINED EFFECTS:
   - Of the three factors, temperature variations typically cause the largest density changes 
     in the upper ocean, while pressure dominates in the deep ocean.
   - In certain regions like the polar oceans, salinity can be the dominant factor controlling density.
   - These density differences drive global ocean circulation patterns.
   - The nonlinear nature of the seawater equation of state leads to important phenomena 
     like cabbeling, where mixing of water masses can increase density.
